# Fake-News-Detection-and-Verification-Tool---Infosys-Springboard

Project overview:

In today’s digital world, the rapid spread of misinformation through news articles and social media posts poses significant risks to public trust, political stability, and public safety. Manual factchecking is slow and resource-intensive, making it difficult to address false information in real time. 
The Fake News Detection & Verification Tool aims to combat misinformation by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning models, and real-time fact-checking APIs. The system will analyze textual content, assess its credibility, and cross-reference facts with reliable sources. Additionally, it will provide explainable results, highlight suspicious claims and linking users to verified references.
